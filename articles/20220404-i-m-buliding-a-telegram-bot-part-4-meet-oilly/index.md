Hey dear fellow developers,

I have a problem remember changing my car oil, I almost every time drive 2000 km more or completely forget the fact that It's been a year since last change.

I needed someone to remind me, someone who I can relay on...

Meet [@OillyBot](https://t.me/OillyBot) your friendly Telegram bot that will always notify you to change your oil on the right time!

See a gif demo ðŸ‘‰ [https://imgur.com/a/rSNZohL](https://imgur.com/a/rSNZohL)

Built in 5 days using **Nodejs** as the backend, **Firebase** as the database, **Vercel** as the hosting and **EasyCron** as the cronjob server.

**%100 free to maintain. Code available on GitHub ðŸ‘‡**

I would highly appreciate your feedback on it.

You can find it on telegram by username @OillyBot or by using this link [t.me/OillyBot](https://t.me/OillyBot).

Cheers
